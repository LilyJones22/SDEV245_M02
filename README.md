Encrypt/Decrypt Demo

---

<p>This program works to both simulate symmetric and asymmetric key encryption very loosely. The biggest spot is that it simply scrambles the letters to replicate encryption, but it shows the concept well enough I hope.</p>

<p>The symmetric option provides the user a key that must be delievered to the reciever in order to open the message.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the asymmetric option assumes you have already maintained the reciever's public key with which to send the message. The reciever must then use the private key that is convienantly accessible to open the message.</p>
